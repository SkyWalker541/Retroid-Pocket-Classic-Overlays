SkyWalker541 Universal Grid Shader - User Guide
================================================

Creator: SkyWalker541

Overview
--------
This package contains two shaders:

1. Universal Version
   - One toggle per system (e.g., Game Boy, GBC, NES, etc.).
   - Only ONE system toggle should be ON at a time. Turning on more than one at once can cause grid misalignment or distortion.
   - If all toggles are set to 0 (OFF), the shader will use the Custom Width and Custom Height parameters instead.

2. Universal PRO Version
   - Same as Universal Version, but each system includes additional resolution-specific toggles for variants of that console's native resolution.
   - Again, only ONE toggle should be ON at a time to avoid conflicts.
   - If all toggles are set to 0 (OFF), the shader will use the Custom Width and Custom Height parameters.

Installation
------------
Place files in the following locations:

- GLSLP files:
  RetroArch/shaders/shaders_glsl/

- GLSL files:
  RetroArch/shaders/shaders_glsl/shaders/

Parameter Controls
------------------
1 = Toggle ON (enable preset resolution for that system)
0 = Toggle OFF (disable preset)

If ALL system toggles are OFF, shader defaults to the custom width and height values.

Available Presets (Universal)
-----------------------------
- Game Boy
- Game Boy Color
- NES
- SNES
- Sega Genesis / Mega Drive
- Neo Geo Pocket / Color
- PlayStation 1
- Game Boy Advance
- Sega Saturn
- Custom (when all toggles are OFF)

Additional Presets (Universal PRO)
----------------------------------
Includes everything in Universal version PLUS separate toggles for alternate resolutions for each supported system.

Usage Tips
----------
- Always make sure only ONE preset toggle is ON at a time.
- For custom scaling, turn ALL presets OFF and adjust Custom Width and Height parameters manually.
- Adjust opacity and line thickness to your preference in shader parameters.
