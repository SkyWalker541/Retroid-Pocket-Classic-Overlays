Please note that there are multiple options available here:

GBC_1240_grid_fullscreen & GBC_1240_grid_fullscreen_white -

One folder utilizes black gridlines, and the other utilizes white gridlines. These are both created to use the full screen of the Retroid Pocket Classic or Ayaneo Pocket DMG. They both have a 1240x1080 screen with an 8:7 aspect ratio.



GBC_1240_grid_integer & GBC_1240_grid_integer_white -

One folder utilizes black gridlines, and the other utilizes white gridlines.
These are both created to be used with perfect integer scaling utilizing the Retroid Pocket Classic or Ayaneo Pocket DMG screens, keeping the GB/GBC 10:9 aspect ratio.


***NOTES***

-Each Overlay Folder contains 3 options within them. This gives the option of having the gridlines be 1,2 or 3 pixels wide.

-When using overlays with white gridlines, I recommend reducing the transparency of the overlay, as the white can wash-out the screen. I keep mine between .25 and .35
Just mess around and see what you like.

-When using overlays for "fullscreen", make sure to turn OFF "Auto-Scale Overlay" in the "On-Screen Overlay" settings of RetroArch. You will also want to go into the Video/Scaling in RetroArch, and set the aspect ratio to 8:7. This will make sure GB and GBC are slightly stretched to fill the complete screen of the device.

-When using integer overlays, go into Video/Scaling in Retroarch and turn on Integer Scale, and set the Aspect Ratio to Core provided.
