***Update 5/7/2025 - Added various Bezel Overlay and Beze_Fade Overlay options for GBA and GBC***

***NOTE: The photo below have different opacity settings, so keep that in mind. They overlay may look darker or lighter than you would like, but you can change that in the overlay Opacity settings.***

***Disclaimer: Please don't be too critical of my work. This is my first attempt at making Overlays***

***MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE FOLLOWING IN THE "On-Screen Overlay" MENU***

- "Hide Overlay When Controller Is Connected" Set this to OFF
- "Auto-Scale Overlay" Set this to OFF
- I also recommend messing with the overlay Opacity. See how you like it.




***Note: These overlays are 100% compatible with the Ayaneo Pocket DMG, as they both use the same screen***

***Note: Added "Experimental" folder containing overlays for 4_3 systems. They are staying in experimental for now...***
