***MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE FOLLOWING IN THE "On-Screen Overlay" MENU***

- "Hide Overlay When Controller Is Connected" Set this to OFF
- "Auto-Scale Overlay" Set this to OFF
- I also recommend messing with the overlay Opacity. See how you like it.




***Note: These overlays are 100% compatible with the Ayaneo Pocket DMG, as they both use the same screen***

***Note: Added "Experimental" folder containing overlays for 4_3 systems. They are staying in experimental for now...***
