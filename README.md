Overlay: DMG_1240_bezel_grid_integer_1px_black with Shader: gameboy-pocket.glslp



***NOTE: The photos below have different opacity settings, so keep that in mind. The overlay may look darker or lighter than you would like, but you can change that in the overlay Opacity settings.***



***Note: Bezel Fade options add a shadow to the edge on the game screen.***

***MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE FOLLOWING IN THE "On-Screen Overlay" MENU.***

- "Hide Overlay When Controller Is Connected" Set this to OFF.
- "Auto-Scale Overlay" Set this to OFF.
- I also recommend messing with the overlay Opacity. See how you like it.




***Note: These overlays are 100% compatible with the Ayaneo Pocket DMG and the Retroid Pocket Mini V2, as they all use the same screen***
