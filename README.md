***Disclaimer: Please don't be too critical of my work. This is my first attempt at making Overlays***

***Please note that, in my limited experience, GBA integer scaling is almost impossible to pull off. The GBA's pixels, and how it processed the image to the screen was strange. Just mess around with overlay and video setting and see what setup you like best***


***GBC Overlays***

Fullscreen Stretch Grid:
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

Integer Grid:
- Black Gridline with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridline with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.




***GBA Overlays***

Fullscreen Grid:
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

Integer Aspect Grid (mimics the rectangle shape of GBA pixels):
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

Integer Square Grid (uses square pixels):
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.




***MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE FOLLOWING IN THE "On-Screen Overlay" MENU***

- "Hide Overlay When Controller Is Connected" Set this to OFF
- "Auto-Scale Overlay" Set this to OFF



***Note: These overlays are 100% compatible with the Ayaneo Pocket DMG, as they both use the same screen***

***Note: Added "Experimental" folder containing PS1 and 4_3 systems. They are staying in experimental for now, since I am not sure I like them how they are. Check them out if you dare.***
