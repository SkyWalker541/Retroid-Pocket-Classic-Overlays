***Disclaimer: Please don't be too critical of my work. This is my first attempt at making Overlays***


***GBC Overlays***

Fullscreen Stretch Grid:
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

Integer Grid:
- Black Gridline with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridline with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.




***GBA Overlays***

Fullscreen Grid:
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

Integer Aspect Grid (mimics the rectangle shape of GBA pixels):
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.
- White Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

Integer Square Grid (uses square pixels):
- Black Gridlines with 1,2, and 3 pixel width varients.

***MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE FOLLOWING IN THE "On-Screen Overlay" MENU***

- "Hide Overlay When Controller Is Connected" Set this to OFF
- "Auto-Scale Overlay" Set this to OFF



***Note: These overlays are 100% compatible with the Ayaneo Pocket DMG, as they both use the same screen***

***Note: Added "Experimental" folder containing PS1 and 4_3 systems. They are staying in experimental for now, since I am not sure that I like them yet.***
